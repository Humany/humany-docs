NOTE: This is widgets **V4** documentation. The [widgets **V3** documentation is over here](https://github.com/Humany/humany-docs/tree/v3/seo). For [more information about widget versions check here](https://github.com/Humany/humany-docs/blob/master/widgets/versions.md).

If you choose to implement SEO indexing on Humany's site, no changes are needed on your own site.
However, using this setup, search engines will link to {your-application-name-in-ace-knowledge}.humany.net rather than your own domain.

In our old version of SEO light, we provided a link on the top of the page to your own site. This will be implemented in SEO version 2.1. See [known-issues.md](known-issues.md)
