# Widget versions

A widget does have version on its own, but inherits version from the implementation it belongs to. Upgrading a widget can be achieved via
- pointing out another implementation
- or, upgrading the implementation that the widget belongs to

When a breaking change is needed in the widget code a new version is branched off. Typically an upgrade to a new version requires some changes to custom CSS and custom plugins.
